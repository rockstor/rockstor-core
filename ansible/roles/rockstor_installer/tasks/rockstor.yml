# TODO: Raise issue to discuss the lock down of ssh to only root
#
# This is needed because Rockstor locks down sshd to allow only the user 'root'.
# Unfortunately, this breaks vagrant which relies on ssh via the user 'vagrant'. This will
# be fairly problematic for any provisioners like ansible, salt, etc which will rely on ssh
# access. Forcing the use of root for provisioning is probably a 'discussion' point!
