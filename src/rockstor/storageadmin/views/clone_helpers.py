    Variant of create_clone but where the share already exists and is to be

    Unmount target share - (via remove_share()).
    Btrfs subvol delete target share (via remove_share()).
    Remove prior target share mount point (dir).
    Move snap source to target share's former location (becomes share on disk).
    Update existing target share db entry with source snap's qgroup / usage.
    Remove source snap's db entry: updated share db entry makes it redundant.
