    Variant of create_clone but where the share already exists and is to be
    supplanted by a snapshot which is effectively moved into the shares prior
    position, both in the db and on the file system. This is achieved thus:
    Unmount target share - (via remove_share()).
    Btrfs subvol delete target share (via remove_share()).
    Remove prior target share mount point (dir).
    Move snap source to target share's former location (becomes share on disk).
    Update existing target share db entry with source snap's qgroup / usage.
    Remove source snap's db entry: updated share db entry makes it redundant.
    Remount share (which now represents the prior snap's subvol relocated).

    :param request:
    :param logger: Logger object to reference
    :param snapshot: Source snapshot/quirk share object to supplant target.
