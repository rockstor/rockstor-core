	    <p>Rockstor can push notifications to you via email. We recommend
	      creating a separate dedicated email account for this purpose.
	      Rockstor will login to this email account and use it to send
	      notifications to another specified email address, such as your
	      personal gmail account.</p>

	<div class="alert alert-warning">
	  <p>Rockstor uses the credentials below to send email notifications. Any
	    system information sent to the root user results in a
	    notification. Rockstor assumes/uses the <b>Sender</b> account and from
	    that account sends emails to the <b>Receiver</b>
	    email address. The <b>Sender</b> email account password is stored in
	    <code>/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd</code> which has restricted
	    permissions. However, we strongly recommend against using a personal
	    or important email account for the <b>Sender</b>. On the other
	    hand the <b>Receiver</b> email address can be anything you have
	    access to and is simply the recipient of the notifications.
	  </p>

	  <p>To test if notifications are setup properly, click
	     on <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-send"></i> icon below to send a
	     test message.
