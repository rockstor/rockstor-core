	    <p>Rockstor can push notifications to you via e-mail. We recommend
	      creating a separate dedicated e-mail account for this purpose.
	      Rockstor will login to this e-mail account and use it to send
	      notifications to another specified e-mail address, such as your
	      personal gmail account.</p>

	  <p>Rockstor uses the credentials below to send e-mail notifications. Any
	    system information sent to the root user results in a
	    notification. Rockstor assumes/uses the <b>Sender</b> account and from
	    that account sends e-mails to the <b>Receiver</b>
	    email address. The <b>Sender</b> e-mail account password is stored in
	    <code>/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd</code> which has restricted
	    permissions. However, we strongly recommend against using a personal
	    or important e-mail account for the <b>Sender</b>. On the other
	    hand the <b>Receiver</b> e-mail address can be anything you have
	    access to and is simply the recipient of the notifications sent.
	  </p>

	  <p>To test if notifications are setup properly, click
	     on <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-send"></i> icon below to send a
	     test message. It may take up to several minutes, but if you do not
	     receive the e-mail, you can find clues
	     in <code>/var/log/maillog</code>.
